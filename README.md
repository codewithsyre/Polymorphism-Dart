# Polymorphism-Dart

# Polymorphism In Dart
Poly means many and morph means forms. 
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
As humans, we have the ability to take on many forms.
We can be a student, a teacher, a parent, a friend, and so on.
Similarly, in object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

# Note: 
In the real world, polymorphism is updating or modifying the feature, function, or implementation that already exists in the parent class.

# Polymorphism By Method Overriding
Method overriding is a technique in which you can create a method in the child class that has the same name as the method in the parent class.
The method in the child class overrides the method in the parent class.

# Note:
If you donâ€™t write @override, the program still runs. But, it is a good practice to write @override.

# Advantage Of Polymorphism In Dart
Subclasses can override the behavior of the parent class.
It allows us to write code that is more flexible and reusable.
